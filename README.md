# Saimon Ventura

## Introduction

I am a professional with an insatiable passion for learning and unwavering courage in the face of the unknown. I began my programming journey with JavaScript, working as a mobile developer. I quickly expanded my horizons to desktop website development using ReactJS and delved deep into the full-stack universe, exploring frameworks like Django, Flask, Laravel, and Express.

To me, a framework is a tool, and my open-minded approach allows me to embrace and learn new frameworks and languages without hesitation. While my predominant expertise lies in ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, and RestAPI, I've also dabbled with GraphQL in personal projects using Apollo.

Throughout my career, one of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the importance of quality. Initially, I prioritized speed, but with experience, I realized that delivering high-quality work is paramount for long-term success. Moreover, I understood the significance of implementing robust tests and ensuring code readability. I believe that well-written code is not just functional but also easily understandable by other developers, promoting collaboration and maintainability.
